### ðŸ“„ [Lightening Dark Data: Does Big Data really need to be Big?](Lightening%20Dark%20Data.pdf)

[cite_start]This research paper investigates "dark data"â€”the vast amount of information that organizations collect but do not use for analytics. [cite_start]The work proposes the Quality-Driven Data Reduction (QDDR) framework and a Dark Data Transformation Module (DDTM) to convert disparate data formats into a unified, analyzable structure, questioning if big data truly needs to be so voluminous.

### ðŸ“„ [Securing OTA Updates: Addressing Integrity Challenges in Autonomous Vehicle Software](Securing%20OTA%20Updates%20Addressing%20Integrity.pdf)

[cite_start]This paper focuses on the critical cybersecurity challenges of Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates for autonomous vehicles. [cite_start]It examines the importance of data and service integrity, discussing security mechanisms like hashing, digital signatures, and frameworks like Uptane to protect against malicious updates and tampering, supported by real-world case studies.
